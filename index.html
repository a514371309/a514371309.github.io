<h1>Hi, welcome to Chao's blog!</h1>
<p> My name is Chao Xi, you can just call me 'chao', which made me super famous in Italy as 'chao' means 'Goodbye' in Italian and being used in their everyday life! Ok, in this blog I will post some small eletronic projects. My interest is to implement different control algorithms by different embedded systems. I hope you can find it useful.</p>
